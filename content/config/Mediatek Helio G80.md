## Configuring AetherSX2 on Helio G80: A General Guide

**Disclaimer:** Optimal settings can vary greatly depending on the specific game you're playing. These are general guidelines to get you started.

## Understanding the Helio G80
The Helio G80 is a capable mid-range processor, but it has its limitations. For smooth PS2 emulation, you'll need to balance performance and visual quality.

## General Configuration Tips
1. **CPU Settings:**
   * **Cores:** Experiment with different core counts based on game demands. Starting with 2-3 cores is often a good starting point.
   * **Speed:** Overclocking might improve performance, but it can also lead to instability. Start with the default speed and adjust as needed.
   * **Interpreter/Compiler:** Generally, the compiler offers better performance, but it can be resource-intensive. Try both and see what works best.

2. **GPU Settings:**
   * **Renderer:** OpenGL is usually the more compatible option, but Vulkan might offer better performance in some cases.
   * **Resolution:** Lowering the resolution can significantly improve performance.
   * **GPU Clock:** Overclocking can boost performance, but it can also lead to instability. Use with caution.

3. **Memory Settings:**
   * **RAM:** Allocate enough RAM for the emulator and the game. Experiment with different values to find the optimal setting.
   * **Swap:** Enable swap memory if you encounter out-of-memory issues, but it can impact performance.

4. **Graphics Settings:**
   * **Texture Filtering:** Bilinear or trilinear filtering can improve texture quality, but it can also be demanding.
   * **Anisotropic Filtering:** This setting can enhance texture detail but is often resource-intensive.
   * **Shader Cache:** Enabling the shader cache can improve loading times but might not have a significant impact on performance.

5. **Other Settings:**
   * **BIOS:** Ensure you're using a compatible BIOS for your desired region.
   * **Cheats:** Use cheats with caution, as they can cause instability.
   * **Game-Specific Tweaks:** Some games might require additional tweaks, such as frame skipping or adjusting internal resolution.

## Additional Tips
* **Experimentation:** Don't be afraid to try different settings. What works for one game might not work for another.
* **Cooling:** Keep your device cool to prevent performance throttling.
* **Battery:** A fully charged battery can provide better performance.
* **Online Resources:** Join emulation communities and forums for specific game-related tips and tricks.
