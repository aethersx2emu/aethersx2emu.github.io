Aethersx2 is a powerful PS2 emulator for Android devices, but getting optimal performance on a Snapdragon 4 Gen 2 chipset can be tricky due to its lower-end specifications. Here's a suggested configuration tailored for your device:

**System Settings:**

* **CPU:**
    * **EE Cyclerate:** Try both options (1 and 2) to see which works better. 
    * **VU Cyclerate:** Similar to EE Cyclerate, experiment to find the ideal setting.
* **Graphics:**
    * **Renderer:** Vulkan is generally preferred, but OpenGL may be better for older devices.
    * **Upscaling:** 1x or 2x should be manageable for your hardware. Avoid higher settings.
    * **Enable Widescreen Patches:** If you want to play games in a wider aspect ratio.
* **Audio:**
    * **Audio Backend:** Choose between OpenSL ES or SDL2 depending on your preference.
    * **Enable Dual Audio:** If you want to hear both original and emulated audio.

**Game-Specific Settings:**

* **Fast/Skip BIOS:** Enable this if you have a PS2 BIOS file, it speeds up boot times.
* **Enable Multi-Threaded VU:** Might improve performance in some games.
* **Enable Game Fixes:** Try enabling specific game fixes if you encounter issues.

**Additional Tips:**

* **Lower in-game graphics settings:** Reduce resolution, texture quality, etc.
* **Use performance profiles:** Aethersx2 allows creating profiles for different games.
* **Close background apps:** Free up system resources for better emulation.
* **Update drivers:** Ensure your graphics and audio drivers are up-to-date.
* **Check online forums and communities:** Look for specific settings shared by users with similar devices.

**Please note:** These are just suggestions, and you might need to experiment to find the best combination for your specific games and preferences.  

Remember, the Snapdragon 4 Gen 2 is not a high-performance chipset, so even with the best settings, some demanding PS2 games might not run perfectly. Focus on less demanding titles or adjust your expectations for smoother gameplay.
