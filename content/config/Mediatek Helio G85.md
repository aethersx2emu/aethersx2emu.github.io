## Configuring AetherSX2 for Helio G85: A General Guide

**Disclaimer:** Optimal settings can vary greatly depending on the specific game you're playing. These are general guidelines. Experimentation is key to finding the best configuration for your device and game.

## Understanding Your Limitations
The Helio G85 is a capable chipset, but it's important to recognize its limitations compared to higher-end processors. Expect to make compromises in terms of graphics quality and performance, especially for demanding PS2 games.

## General Settings

* **Enable Frame Limit:** Off (To avoid stuttering)
* **Enable Game Fixes:** On
* **Fast Boot:** On
* **Enable Patch Codes:** Off (Unless you know what you're doing)
* **Expand to Cutout Area:** Off (Unless you have a display cutout)

## System Settings

* **EE Cycle Rate (Underclocking):** Experiment with values between 100% (0) and lower. A lower value can improve stability but might impact performance.
* **EE Cycle Skip (Underclocking):** Normal (0)
* **Enable Multi-Threaded VU1:** On (Can improve performance in some games)
* **Enable Fastmem:** On (Generally improves performance)
* **Enable Affinity Control:** Off
* **Enable Fast CDVD:** Off (Can cause issues in some games)

## Graphics Settings

* **Renderer:** Vulkan (Generally better performance)
* **GPU Clock:** Experiment with different values to find the best balance between performance and stability.
* **Hardware Transform:** On (If supported by your device)
* **Internal Resolution:** Experiment with different resolutions. Higher resolutions can improve image quality but will impact performance.
* **Anisotropic Filtering:** Off (To save performance)
* **Anti-Aliasing:** Off (To save performance)

## Additional Tips

* **Game-Specific Settings:** Some games might require specific settings. Search for guides related to the game you're playing.
* **BIOS:** Using a compatible BIOS can improve compatibility and performance.
* **Compatibility:** Not all PS2 games will run perfectly on a Helio G85 device. Some games might have issues regardless of settings.
* **Experimentation:** The best way to find optimal settings is through trial and error.
