**There seems to be a misunderstanding.**

**Winning Eleven 2024 does not exist for the PS2 console.** 

The PlayStation 2 (PS2) is an older generation console, and game developers typically focus on newer platforms for their latest titles. The Winning Eleven series, which evolved into the Pro Evolution Soccer (PES) franchise, has been primarily developed for more recent consoles and PC platforms. 

## The Winning Eleven Legacy on PS2

While there isn't a Winning Eleven 2024 for PS2, the series enjoyed immense popularity on the platform during its heyday. Titles like Winning Eleven 7 International, Winning Eleven 8, and Winning Eleven 9 were fan favorites, offering engaging gameplay and realistic football experiences for their time.

## Modern Football Gaming on PS2 Alternatives

If you're looking for football gaming on a PS2, you might consider exploring other sports titles available for the console. While not specifically football, games like FIFA Soccer or other sports compilations might offer alternatives. 

**For the best and most up-to-date football gaming experience, consider exploring titles for modern consoles like PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, or PC.**
