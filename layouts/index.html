<h2>Requestment</h2>
<p>Requirements for installing aethersx2 are a minimum of Android 7.0 (Nougat) and above and an architecture supported by Arm64 (64bit).
<p>To use aethersx2 smoothly and smoothly when playing games, we recommend that you meet the following specifications:</p>
<h3>Android</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Prosesor :  Use Minimum <i>Qualcomm Snapdragon 870</i> 
</li>
<li>
Android Version : Android 10 +
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Windows</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Prosesor : Use Minimum <i>Intel core i3 gen 10 +</i>
</li>
<li>
Windows Version : <i>Windows 10 +</i>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Linux</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Prosesor : Use Minimum <i>Intel core i3 gen 10 +</i>
</li>
<li>
Linux Version : <i>Ubuntu 20 +</i>
</li>
</ul>
<h2> How To improve Device performance</h2>
<ul>
<li>Use Skia's Vulkan renderer, especially if your device uses a Mali GPU.  but in some games it may not support you can use opengl if that happens.</li>
<li>For some devices using Mali gpu, enabling the <i>Threaded Presentation</i> feature in <i>Advanced Settings</i> can improve performance significantly but in some devices it will crash (for example google pixel 7)</li>
<li>Underclock the CPU, which is able to mimic the performance pipeline by setting the cycle rate to a negative number, and skip cycles to a positive number in System settings.  This will crash some games, and cause crashes when this feature is enabled if the game does not support it.</li>
<li>If the game slows down depending on your eyes, this may be due to the GS download renderer, which is very slow on low spec GPUs.  You can toggle the hardware download mode feature to Asynchronous or Disabled, but this may cause some problems to the app and it may crash.</li>
<li>You could try switching the SPU3's mixing mode to Async Mix instead of Timestretch.  But in some games it is not compatible, it is recommended to try it first.</li>
<li>For some devices (e.g. Sony, Xiaomi, Samsung and Pixel), using affinity control can increase performance to the highest level.</li>
<li>Lowering the number of gpu renders can improve performance, but this will hurt the image quality (suitable for low spec devices).</li>
<li>If after updating the aethersx2 application it becomes slow and the performance seems to be slow, you can delete the data and cache then enter the application again.</li>
<li>Use the <code>OpenGL</code> renderer if your device has low specifications.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Features</h2>
<h3>GPU</h3>
<ul>
<li>Supports 3 modern renderers, namely OpenGL, Vulkan and software.  adjust this renderer to your device's specifications, because if it doesn't match it will reduce performance or the game will crash.</li>
<li>Adding a resolution level feature from the smallest 1.5x to 8x will make the game display clearer, but in some games this is not supported.</li>
<li>Offers custom bilenier filtering that you can choose nearest-neightbot (point), bilenier (forced), bilenier (ps2), bilenier (forced excluding sprite).</li>
<li>Mipmaping : automatic, off, basic, full (ps2 mips).
<li>Support cusrom trilinear filtering.
<li>anisotropic filtering 1x to 16x.
<li>Blending Accuracy minimum, basic, medium, hight, full, ultra.
<li>Texture Preloading : partial and full.
<li>Aspect Ratio : Sretch, auto standard, strandard, widescreen.
</ul>

<h2>Settings</h2>
<p>However, achieving a smooth and optimal gaming experience requires proper configuration of AetherSX2. Each Android device has different specifications, and each PS2 game demands different resources. Therefore, it's crucial to tailor AetherSX2 settings to match your device and the games you play.</p>

<p>Here are some tips for configuring AetherSX2:</p>

<h3>1. General Settings</h3>
<ul>
<li> <b>Fast Boot:</b> Enable to accelerate game loading times.
<li> <b>Enable Logging:</b> Disable to enhance performance.
</ul>
<h3>2. Graphics Settings</h3>

<ul>
<li> <b>Backend:</b> Vulkan generally delivers superior performance on modern devices.
<li> <b>Renderer:</b> OpenGL provides a good balance between compatibility and performance.
<li> <b>Frame Skipping:</b> Adjust between 0-1 as needed for smooth gameplay.
<li> <b>Upscaling:</b> 2x-3x depending on your device's screen resolution and performance.
<li> <b>Internal Resolution:</b> Native or 1.5x. Higher resolutions can enhance visuals but impact performance.
<li> <b>Anisotropic Filtering:</b> 2x-4x improves texture quality at a slight performance cost.
<li> <b>Enable Shader Interpreter:</b> Enable to assist with compatibility, but it can affect performance.
<li> <b>Vertex Cache:</b> Enable to improve performance in some games.
</ul>
<h3>3. EE/IOP Settings</h3>
<ul>
<li> <b>EE Rec:</b> Disable to boost performance, but it might cause issues in some games.
<li> <b>VU Rec:</b> Disable to enhance performance, but it could lead to problems in certain games.
<li> <b>Multithreaded RSX:</b> Enable to improve performance on multi-core devices.
<li> <b>Emotion Engine:</b> Interpreter offers better compatibility.
<li> <b>IOP:</b> Interpreter provides superior compatibility.
</ul>

<h3>4. Advanced Settings</h3>
<p>These settings require more experimentation and may vary depending on the specific game you are playing.</p>
<ul>
<li> <b>Enable Widescreen Patches:</b> Enable if available for the game.</li>
<li> <b>Enable Game Fixes:</b> Enable if available for the game.</li>
<li> <b>Other options:</b> Experiment with settings like "MTVU," "Disable Hacks," and "Software Skinning" to see if they improve performance or compatibility in particular games.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Important Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li> <b>Device-Specific Optimization:</b> Remember that performance can differ between devices even with the same chipset. Be prepared to fine-tune these settings based on your specific device and the games you are playing.
<li> <b>Game Compatibility:</b> Some games may require specific settings or hacks to run correctly on AetherSX2. Research online or consult the AetherSX2 community for game-specific recommendations.
<li> <b>Performance Monitoring:</b> Use tools like built-in FPS counters or external apps to monitor performance during gameplay. Adjust settings as needed to maintain a smooth experience.
</ul>


<p>By optimizing your AetherSX2 configuration, you can enjoy a seamless and satisfying PS2 gaming experience on your Android device.</p>


We will provide aethersx2 settings that are suitable for your device, so that the experience of using aethersx2 is smoother.  We divide it into two settings, namely <b>Low End</b> for devices with low specifications (device specifications below Snapdragon 870) and <b>High End</b> Devices with high specifications (device specifications above Snapdragon 870).

<h2>Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li>Force GPU Rendering: enable this feature in device settings <code>Settings</code> > <code>Developer Options</code> > <code>Enable Force GPU Rendering</code>.  Enabling this feature will improve performance and graphic quality but drains battery usage, we recommend deactivating it when not playing games.</li>
<li>Force 4X MSAA: enable this feature in device settings <b>Settings</b> > <b>Developer Options</b> > <b>Enable Force 4x MSAA</b>.  Enabling this feature will improve performance but drains battery usage, we recommend deactivating it when not playing games.</li>
<li>Game Mode: Activate Game Mode if your device provides this feature, game mode on default devices usually provides more effective performance options.</li>
<li>Battery Saver: Make sure you activate battery saver mode on your device to provide maximum performance.</li>
<li>Use a cooler or be in a cool place, so that processor performance remains stable when playing games.  because if your cellphone gets hot, the processor performance will automatically decrease.</li>
<li>Use a USB controller so that control when playing games is easier and more comfortable, this will improve your gaming experience.</li>
